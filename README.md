# bgc-ann

Marine ecosystem models are important to identify the processes that affects for example the global carbon cycle. Computation of an annually periodic solution (i.e., a steady annual cycle) for these models requires a high computational effort. To reduce this effort, we approximated an exemplary marine ecosystem model by different artificial neural networks (ANNs). We used a fully connected network, then applied the sparse evolutionary training (SET) procedure, and finally applied a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize both the network topology.
